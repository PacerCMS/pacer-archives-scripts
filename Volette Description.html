<p><em>The Volette</em> was the student newspaper at the University of Tennessee Junior College, later the University of Tennessee Martin Branch and today the <a href="http://www.utm.edu/">University of Tennessee at Martin</a>, from 1928 to 1971. The paper was produced periodically (weekly, bi-weekly and monthly depending on the year) throughout the academic year. In the fall of 1971, the newspaper was renamed <em><a href="http://www.thepacer.net">The Pacer</a></em>.</p>
<p>Issues have been digitized from microfilm at the <a href="https://sos.tn.gov/products/tsla/guide-manuscript-materials-microfilm-mf-900-mf-999">Tennessee State Library and Archives (Microfilm Number 912)</a> in Nashville, Tennessee. Additional holdings are available at the <a href="http://library.utm.edu/record=b1334330">Paul Meek Library</a> in Martin, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Issue and volume numbers are known to be inconsistent, often duplicated or omitted entirely. For archival purposes, the displayed issue number is recorded with the issue, while the volume number is measured as academic year of publication, with the fall of 1928 starting Volume 1.</p>
<p>The quality of the scans varies among issues. In cases where a page is overexposed or darkened, the original microfilm may provide better legibility for research purposes.</p>
