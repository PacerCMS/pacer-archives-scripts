<p><em><a href="http://www.thepacer.net">The Pacer</a></em> is the student newspaper at the University of Tennessee at Martin. It is a continuation of the first student newspaper, <em>The Volette</em>, at the then-named University of Tennessee Junior College. The newspaper changed its name in the fall of 1971. It is produced periodically (weekly, bi-weekly and monthly depending on the year) throughout the academic year.</p>
<p>Issues from the fall of 1971 to the spring 1985 have been digitized from microfilm at the <a href="https://sos.tn.gov/products/tsla/guide-manuscript-materials-microfilm-mf-900-mf-999">Tennessee State Library and Archives (Microfilm Number 912)</a> in Nashville, Tennessee. Later issues are a combination of microfilm scans, original print production files and further digitization of the orignial printed edition.</p>
<p>Issue and volume numbers are known to be inconsistent, often duplicated or omitted entirely. For archival purposes, the displayed issue number is recorded with the issue, while the volume number is measured as academic year of publication, with the fall of 1928 starting Volume 1.</p>
<p>The quality of the scans varies among issues. In cases where a page is overexposed or darkened, the original microfilm or physical copy may provide better legibility for research purposes.</p>
